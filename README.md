# SpringMvcApplication
The basic system architecture based on MVC, Spring.NET.

Here are I will build the basic system architecute based on Spring.NET and MVC.

And I will build the sytem with the classic three layers. UI, BLL, DAL;

UI: CSHTML, JS, Jquery.
BLL: The controller will invoke the correspoding the interface exposured by BLL and get the data from the DAL.
DAL: The data access layer will be implementated by the Spring DAO to acess the SQL/Oracle.

About the UI ,I will add the most of the features of greatest js framework, sucn as Augular Js,bootstrap, knockout js, react js ,which i will add a fully-fledged function to invoke the backend BLL.
